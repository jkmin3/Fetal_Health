# Fetal-Health-Prediction  

## Fetal Health Dataset
This dataset contained a variety of features on newborns and it had its classification of 1-Normal, 2-Suspect, 3-Pathological.

## Random Forest
I used many different models with scikit-learn to predict the outcome of the health of a fetus and ended up using a random forest. I got a result of a 94% accurate model.

Feel free to use my code and the dataset!
